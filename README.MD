## Instruction
- For simplicity reason, all of the dependencies are pushed to Git, so this project is ready to use
- Open `TabcorpTest.xcworkspace`
- Press `Command + R` to run the app
- Press `Command + U` to run unit tests

## Note
- I forgot to change my user name for the first commit, so you can see two contributors `alexgao11` (which is me) and `alex-chq` (which is me on my current company's Mac)
